# Database
- mongo: no real benefit, https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose still needs some schema/models to work
- sqlite: serverless
- postgres: besides relational, it can also store json and do queries on it

Tools
- https://github.com/dbcli better CLIs for pg, my, liteâ€¦
  - `litecli` (CLI, sqlite) REPL with auto-completion and syntax highlighting
- `sqlcrush` https://github.com/coffeeandscripts/sqlcrush (TUI, SQLite3/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- `sqlite-analyzer` analyze how space is allocated inside an SQLite file

Use https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm with sqlite first, and change to postgres if needed.

GUI tools tried for sqlite:
`brew cask install db-browser-for-sqlite mesasqlite navicat-for-sqlite sqlitemanager sqlitestudio sqlpro-for-sqlite dbeaver-community`
Deleted (paid):
`brew cask uninstall sqlitemanager navicat-for-sqlite sqlpro-for-sqlite`
sqlitestudio seems fine.
